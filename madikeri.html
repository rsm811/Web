                Abbey falls are part of the river Kaveri. The location of abbey falls is in the center of private coffee and aromatic 
                spices plantations. This is called the spice estate. A businessman called Mr. Neravanda B.Nanaiah bought this place from 
                the Karnataka government for its restoration and up-gradation. He changed the outlook of the place from a dark forest to 
                a tourist spot. So, now this place has an enchanting view with coffee plantations all around.<br> 
                These waterfalls at the height of 70 feet will mesmerize you. There is a hanging bridge which is constructed at some 
                distance from the Abbey falls, but the view from the bridge will take your breath away. Tourists visit Abbey falls 
                throughout the year but monsoon and winters are the best seasons to enjoy the scenic beauty and plenty of water. Roadways 
                connect Coorg to Mangalore, Bangalore, Mysore and many other important cities. Madikeri village is just 10 km away from Coorg. 
                So, Abbey falls is well connected from all over the country.
