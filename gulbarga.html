            <h4>
                The temple is dedicated to an eminent Lingayat religious teacher and philosopher, Shri Sharana Basaveshwara,a Lingayat 
                saint of the 12th century known for his Dasoha (Giving is earning) and Kayaka — an advancement of the Karma doctrine 
                "You have the right to perform the work assigned to you. You have no rights to 'demand' the fruits of your labor" 
                philosophy. The temple houses the Samadhi of Sharana Basaveshwara at the center called the garbha gudi. It also has 
                a lake adjacent to it which attracts many devotees and tourists.<br>
                People from across the country and abroad cutting across communal lines will converge on the sprawling temple complex 
                to witness the historic car festival. On the occasion, the people will also have a glimpse of the silver plate 
                (Prasada Battala) used by the saint. The Prasada Battala, which is displayed once in a year during the car festival, 
                would be shown to the devotees. Along with the Prasada Battala, the devotees will get a chance to have a look at 
                the Linga Sajjike (the cover used for keeping the Linga) made in Sandalwood and used by Sharanabhasaveshwara.
                people, particularly farmers from the region, continue the practice of donating a portion of their harvest to the 
                temple for providing free food to pilgrims visiting the temple.

                The Gulbarga fort was razed to the ground by the Vijayanagar Emperor but was subsequently rebuilt by Yusuf Adil Shah
                (1459–1511), who established the Adil Shah dynasty or Bijapur Sultanate, when he defeated the Vijayanagar emperor. 
                The Vijayanagara Empire was plundered and with this rich booty, the Gulbarga fort was refurbished.<br>
                The early history of the region dates back to the 6th century when the Rashtrakutas ruled over the external areas, 
                except Gulbarga city. The Chalukyas won back their domain and ruled for over two hundred years. The Kalachuris of Kalyani 
                succeeded them and ruled till the 12th century. At the end of the 12th century, it came under the reign of the Yadavas 
                of Devagiri and the Hoysalas of Halebid. During this period, the Kakatiya dynasty, kings of Warangal were also 
                powerful and took control of the present Gulbarga district and Raichur District.

          to Sannati to free her devotee Chandravadani who was held captive by an evil king named Setu Raya.

        Buddha Vihar features delightful artistic designs and an impeccable blend of architectural elements fused within. 
        The construction began in 2002 and was originally perceived to be much smaller. The blueprint was however changed 
        by the Trust to make it into a massive complex and one of the best ones in South India.<br>
        Almost 250 tonnes of steel, 1,500 tonnes of cement, 200 cubic metres of sand and 5 lakh bricks were used by 
        craftsmen and artisans to design this extraordinary masterpiece. Spread across 18 acres, the structure stands 
        strong on 32,450 square feet of land with 284 blocks on 170 pillars.<br>
        There is a meditation centre at the basement while there are four Ashoka pillars, each one standing tall at 48 feet 
        in the corners of the main building. These pillars symbolize the four noble truths, the truth of suffering, 
        the truth of the cause of suffering, cessation of suffering and the truth of the path which leads to the end of 
        suffering.
