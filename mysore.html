                Of the seven palaces that dot the cityscape of Mysore, this royal edifice is the most splendid one. The palace had its 
                foundation laid way back in the 14th century by the Wodeyars or Wadiyars, the royal family of Mysore. It is believed 
                that Yaduraya Wodeyar, the first ruler of the Mysore Kingdom, built a palace in Puragiri aka the Old Fort during his 
                reign. This palace, which is believed to be the predecessor of the current palace, has been demolished and reconstructed 
                multiple times over a period of six centuries.<br>
                Above the central arch, there is a divine sculpture of Gajalakshmi – the goddess of wealth with two elephants. In 
                addition to the three entrances, located on the eastern, southern, and western sides, the palace features several 
                secret tunnels. There is also a group of temples at the palace, built from the 14th to the 20th century.

        The original temple complex was massive, with an area of around 50 acres (20 ha) 100 by 60 yards (91 m × 55 m).
        The complex was a symmetrical building enclosed by two 'prakaras' and the outer gate (Mahadwara) had verandahs on both sides, 
        flanked by the yagasala and the kitchen. This was enclosed by the second mahadwara, which led to the inner enclosure and was 
        akin to the Somanathapura temple.<br>
        The main idol of Venugopala Swamy, Lord Krishna playing the flute as a cow-herd, was also shifted to a new temple premises 
        in the rehabilitated village. The Eshwara temple is deep inside the waters and visible only when the waters recede rarely to 
        the lowest level of 35 feet. The 700-year-old Venugopala Swamy Temple, however, showed up almost every year due to inadequate 
        rainfall.
