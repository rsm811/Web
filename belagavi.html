            The history of the Royal Palace in its current form is not very old; it was built in 1900 at the request of King Leopold II. 
            However, the ruins under the palace, on which it was built, are centuries old. These ruins are remnants of Coudenberg Palace, 
            a very old palatial complex dating back to the 11th century. It was a home of the Dukes of Brabant who together with other 
            successors extended and improved the palace for many centuries. Unfortunately, this prestigious complex was destroyed by a fire 
            in 1731.<br>
            Almost 50 years after the disaster, there were four separate buildings built on the ruins. Two of them were connected by a 
            colonnade from the initiative of King William II of the Netherlands. It was already built in the neoclassical style with a peristyle, 
            under the supervision of Belgian architect Tilman-François Suys.

           Located in the Belgaum Fort compound, Ramakrishna Mission Ashram is a calm and quiet place serving as a retreat to its 
           visitors from the bustle of Belgaum. The building where Swami Vivekananda stayed for nine days when he visited Belgaum in 1892 
           was handed over to the Ramakrishna Mission for Spiritual and Social purposes. The ashram was built in 2001, right after the renovation 
           of the existing was completed.<br>
           The Ashram now has a Sharada Mantapa which constitutes for the kitchen, dining hall and a residence for the Monks. 
           Ramakrishna Mission Ashram organises numerous welfare activities, lectures, daily Bhajans, meditation classes to educate,

        The fort on top of hill is visible from almost all areas of Belagavi. It is also believed that there existed a secret 
        tunnel from the Belagavi fort upto Rajhunsgad during the ancient period. In this fort, a beautiful Temple of 
        ‘Lord Shiva’ is situated where most of the people staying in and around the villages of this fort visit and pray every Monday. 
        There is Well of sweet water on top of this hill. It is infact an admirable archeology of the past architects and rulers. 
        An awesome view of Belgaum City can be had from this fort.<br>
        One can reach Rajhunsgad village on the foot of this hill via- Desur village or from Yellur & Sulga and then climb 
        the fort on kutcha road. Experienced riders can reach upto the entrance of the fort on top on Motorcycles but this path 
        (kutcha road) is too steep for motorcycles. However, this is an excellent place for Trekking.
