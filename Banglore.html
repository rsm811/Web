                and statues of famous personages, in its precincts.<br>

                after the longest-serving commissioner of the time, Sir Mark Cubbon. To commemorate the Silver Jubilee of Sri Krishnaraja Wodeyar’s rule in Mysore State, in 1927, 
                the park was again renamed as Sri. Chamarajendra Park, in memory of the 19th-century ruler of the state Sri Chamarajendra Wodeyar (1868–94), 
                during whose rule the park came into existence.<br>

        Nandi Hills (Anglicised forms include Nandidurg and Nandydoorg) is an ancient hill fortress built by Ganga Dynasty 
        and later enlarged and strengthened by Tipu Sultan in southern India, in the Chikkaballapur district of Karnataka state. 
        It is 10 km from Chickballapur town and approximately 60 km from Bengaluru. The hills are near the town Nandi.<br>
        In traditional belief, the hills are the origin of the Arkavathy river,Ponnaiyar River, Palar River, Papagni and Penna River.
        Watching the sunrise at Nandi Hills is popular with tourists. The first ever SAARC summit hosted by India was held at Nandi Hills in 1986.<br>
        There are many stories about the origin of the name Nandi Hills. During the Chola period, Nandi Hills was called Anandagiri meaning The Hill of Happiness.
        It is also perhaps called Nandi Hills because the hills resemble a sleeping bull. Another theory holds that the hill gets its name from an ancient, 1300-year-old 
        Dravidian-style Nandi is temple situated on this hill.<br>
        Nandidurga was traditionally held impregnable, and its storming by the army of Cornwallis on 19 October 1791 was one of the most notable incidents of the first war against Tipu Sultan of Mysore. 
        A description of the siege is given in Browne's History of Scotland and the records of the 71st Highlanders.
