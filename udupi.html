                Udupi Anantheshwara Temple is a historic Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Ananteshwara Parashurama (an avatar of Vishnu). 
                The Anantheshwara temple is located in Udupi, India. The temple is a unique temple where Parashurama is worshiped in the 
                form of Shiva Linga. Writer Roshen Dalal says, "According to texts, the city formed part of Parashurama Kshetra, the area 
                is said to be claimed by Parashurama from the sea. Legends state that a king name Ramabhoja worshipped Parashurama here 
                in the form of Shiva Linga, which then manifests itself on a silver seat (rajata pitha). Thus in Sanskrit texts, the 
                city is known as Rajata Pitha".<br>
                The temple was renovated during the reign of the Alupas in the 8th century C.E. and is considered among the oldest in the 
                Tulu Nadu region. Ananteshwara Temple is close to Chandramouleshwara Temple, the temple dedicated to Lord Shiva.
                The temple is adjacent to the more famous Udupi Sri Krishna Matha established by saint Shri Madhvacharya, who preached 
                Dvaita philosophy in Udupi.

                The Koodlu Theertha is a spectacular waterfall that descends from a height of about 300 feet. It plunges straight into 
                a pond. Legend has it that thousands of years ago sages used to meditate near the place where the pond exists today. 
                As such, the local people consider the water of the pond to be very holy.<br>
                Apart from the scenic beauty of the water taking a deep plunge from the mountains above, the place is also known for 
                its serene atmosphere. The calm and tranquillity found near the waterfall is only disturbed by the roar of the water 
                falling from the high position. Else, the uninhabited area is a place that is far removed from the hustle bustle of 
                city life and nature seems to rule over the place.

        The original temple complex was massive, with an area of around 50 acres (20 ha) 100 by 60 yards (91 m Ã— 55 m).
        The complex was a symmetrical building enclosed by two 'prakaras' and the outer gate (Mahadwara) had verandahs on both sides, 
        flanked by the yagasala and the kitchen. This was enclosed by the second mahadwara, which led to the inner enclosure and was 
        akin to the Somanathapura temple.<br>
        The main idol of Venugopala Swamy, Lord Krishna playing the flute as a cow-herd, was also shifted to a new temple premises 
        in the rehabilitated village. The Eshwara temple is deep inside the waters and visible only when the waters recede rarely to 
        the lowest level of 35 feet. The 700-year-old Venugopala Swamy Temple, however, showed up almost every year due to inadequate 
        rainfall.
