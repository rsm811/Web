                Virupaksha Temple is located in Hampi in the Vijayanagara district of Karnataka, India. It is not a part of the Group 
                of Monuments at Hampi, designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The temple is dedicated to Lord Virupaksha, 
                a form of Shiva. The temple was built by Lakkan Dandesha, a nayaka (chieftain) under the ruler Deva Raya II 
                also known as Prauda Deva Raya of the Vijayanagara Empire.<br>
                Hampi, capital of the Vijayanagara empire, sits on the banks of the Tungabhadra River. Virupaksha Temple is the 
                main center of pilgrimage at Hampi, and had been considered the most sacred sanctuary over the centuries. It is 
                intact among the surrounding ruins and is still used in worship . The temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva, known here 
                as Virupaksha, as the consort of the local goddess Pampadevi who is associated with the Tungabhadra River. There is 
                also a Virupakshini Amma temple (mother goddess) in a village called Nalagamapalle, Chittoor district, Andhra Pradesh, 
                approximately 100 km from Tirupati.

                As the name given to the palace is because of the shape it resembles. The balcony and the passages covered with a 
                dome that looks like an opened lotus bud. The central dome is also carved as a lotus bud. The curves of the palace 
                are given an Islamic touch while the multi-layered roof design is moreover related to Indo style of buildings. The 
                style and designs is an inquisitive blend of Islamic and Indian way of architecture.<br>
                The palace is a two-storied building, well-structured symmetrically. It is surrounded by a rectangular wall and four 
                towers. These towers are also in pyramidal shape giving a lotus-like structure visual. Around 24 pillars are present 
                to support the arched windows and balcony of the palace. The walls and pillars are carved beautifully with patterns 
                like sea creatures and birds.

            The Lakshmi Narasimha statue and the temple housing the statue were built in the year 1528 A.D. It was constructed 
            during the rule of Krishnadevaraya, one of the greatest rulers of the Vijayanagara Empire. The temple is dedicated 
            to Lord Narasimha, one of the ten avatars of Lord Vishnu, and Goddess Lakshmi. As such, the temple is known as the 
            Lakshmi Narasimha Temple.<br>
            The original sculpture had a small figure of Goddess Lakshmi, consort of Narasimha, sitting on his lap. The gigantic 
            statue was vandalized and mutilated in 1565 A.D. during the raid by the Mughals that led to the fall of the Vijayanagara Empire.<br>
            The limbs of Narasimha’s statue were broken during the attack. The figure of Lakshmi was separated from that of Narasimha. 
            In the process of destruction, one of the hands of Goddess Lakshmi was broken and even today the broken hand of the 
            Goddess can be seen resting on the back of Narasimha.

        <h4>
            Coracles, also known as Dongis sometimes, are round boats traditionally used to ferry people and livestock across 
            rivers. They have been used in many parts of Asia such as India and Vietnam as well as in parts of Europe such as 
            Wales and Ireland.The coracles of Hampi are made of bamboo and plastic. They are used to take tourists, max 6-8 people 
            at a time, across the Tungabhadra river for an enjoyable ride.<br>
            You will notice stairs at many places. Those are the spots where you can alight and explore. Some of the temples are 
            still in use. You will see remains of worship and offerings lying around sometimes. I have a strong feeling there 
            should be dustbins around, but sadly there aren’t.<br>
            You will also notice big holes in the boulders as you cross them. These are the results of erosion when rainwater 
            raises the levels of water in Tungabhadra. The rainy season is considered dangerous to ride a coracle and these 
            services are closed at that time.

        While most tourists stay to the south of Tungabhadra where most of the ruins are located, some prefer the north banks 
        which have a vibrant hippie culture. Virapapur Gadde or Hippie Island is a small island situated across the Tungabhadra 
        river. It takes 5 minutes to travel to the island via coracle or boat. The last boat for the island leaves at 5.30 pm. 
        The backpacker's delight, Hippie Island (Virupapur Gadde) is an epitome of scenic beauty and is known for laidback 
        ambient and lodges.<br>
        During the peak, season backpackers storm this area. It has small tourist huts which are offered at quite reasonable 
        prices. The island has small cafes which are a joint venture of Indians and foreigners who stayed back to the place 
        after it mesmerized them. A coracle ferry is needed to reach this side of the river. During the monsoon season, it 
        is advisable to take a taxi to another end which is 40 km away.
